## Inspiration
COVID-19 wrought an onslaught of problems concerning privacy due to the increase in video calls where people are required to share their video. Through creating an initially simple pixelation AR filter, we realized that by adding additional customizations we enable users to utilize their own creativity in making skits specializing in reveals or hiding things.

## What it Does
PicselAR gives users a way to pixelate their background through various means (e.g., hand gesture/slider, distance to a virtual object, and audio level). It also gives rise to skit creation with Instagram Reels as demonstrated above.

#### Hand Gesture/Slider

This option grants users the most convenient degree of customization over how their background is perceived. It is most useful if one has no need to pixelate their background or it needs to be pixelated the entire time regardless of the context it is used in.

#### Virtual Object
We believe this option to be the least useful in a professional setting but the one with the most potential for creativity. Users can place an object somewhere in a virtual 3D space and the camera's distance to it determines the background's pixelation. This feature could be used in creating short horror skits when paired with a dark environment or for creating skits that involve movement.

#### Audio Level
While it cannot be easily conveyed through a visual format, if the user's microphone picks up audio above a certain threshold, the background will be pixelated as much as possible. We envision this being used to prevent a person's home life being exposed in case someone begins yelling or barges in to their room. On the more light-hearted side of things, it could be used in a skit in which someone attempts to hide something from someone.
