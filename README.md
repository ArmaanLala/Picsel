# Picsel

# What?
Picsel is an augmented reality filter built using [Facebook's Spark AR Studio](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio).

## Why?
Given the many problems onset by the COVID-19 pandemic, we took it upon ourselves to combine art with problem-solving to create a solution to privacy concerns that came with the increase in online schooling. A common problem is with people's background audio and video causing disruptions during class or online assessments. This gives users a degree of privacy while also providing a new for skits to be made.
